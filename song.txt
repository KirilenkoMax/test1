Took a ride to the end of the lane
Where no one ever goes
Ended up on a broken train with nobody I know
But the pain and the longing's the same
When you're dyin'
Now I'm lost, and I'm screaming for help alone

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you
